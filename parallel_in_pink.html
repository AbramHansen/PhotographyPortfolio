                <p>
                    This photo was taken in the beautiful desert just outside Phoenix Arizona which had recently come alive with the arrival of spring. 
                    I love the way these two saguaros divide up the landscape into three equal sections providing balance to the scene. 
                    The two cacti draw your eye from the top of the image down into the background. 
                    These layered mountains make it seem like the desert continues forever.

                    It was only on the second editing pass of this photo that I noticed the subtle pink hues present in the scene caused by the setting sun. 
                    I know that this was to be the tone of the image. 
                    The softness of pink contrasts with the sharp nature of cacti. 
                    The colors bring a gentleness and stillness to these giants of the Arizona desert.
