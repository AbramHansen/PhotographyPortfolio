                    Welcome to my gallery! 
                    I'm thrilled to share my passion for capturing the emotions of the landscape. 
                    My name is Abram Hansen, and I hail from the picturesque landscapes of Eastern Idaho, a place I proudly call home. 
                    My heart has always belonged to the enchanting landscapes of the West, which continuously inspire me to explore and seek out new adventures.

                    While I am currently a dedicated student pursuing a degree in software engineering, my true love lies in venturing outdoors and immersing myself in the wonders of nature. 
                    The tranquility and raw beauty of the natural world have always captivated my soul, and it is through photography that I can convey the emotions and stories that unfold in these awe-inspiring settings.

                    I enjoy expansive panoramas that convey the vastness and grandeur of the landscapes. 
                    I aim to push the boundaries of my creativity and experiment with innovative techniques. 
                    Through the lens, I strive to find unique perspectives and reveal the hidden beauty that lies beneath the surface, inviting others to see the world through my eyes. 
                    As you explore my portfolio, I hope you will be able to see what I saw the day I captured the images.

                    Thank you for visiting, and I hope that my photographs ignite your own appreciation for the wonders of nature.
