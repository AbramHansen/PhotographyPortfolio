      <h3>About the Photographer</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my gallery! I'm thrilled to share my passion for capturing the emotions of the landscape. My name is Abram Hansen, and I hail from the picturesque landscapes of Eastern Idaho, a place I proudly call home. My heart has always belonged to the enchanting landscapes of the West, which continuously inspire me to explore and seek out new adventures.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I am currently a dedicated student pursuing a degree in software engineering, my true love lies in venturing outdoors and immersing myself in the wonders of nature. The tranquility and raw beauty of the natural world have always captivated my soul, and it is through photography that I can convey the emotions and stories that unfold in these awe-inspiring settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy expansive panoramas that convey the vastness and grandeur of the landscapes. I aim to push the boundaries of my creativity and experiment with innovative techniques. Through the lens, I strive to find unique perspectives and reveal the hidden beauty that lies beneath the surface, inviting others to see the world through my eyes. As you explore my portfolio, I hope you will be able to see what I saw the day I captured the images.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting, and I hope that my photographs ignite your own appreciation for the wonders of nature. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

      <h3>Parallel in Pink</h3>
      <p>
        This photo was taken in the beautiful desert just outside Phoenix Arizona which had recently come alive with the arrival of spring. I love the way these two saguaros divide up the landscape into three equal sections providing balance to the scene. The two cacti draw your eye from the top of the image down into the background. These layered mountains make it seem like the desert continues forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was only on the second editing pass of this photo that I noticed the subtle pink hues present in the scene caused by the setting sun. I know that this was to be the tone of the image. The softness of pink contrasts with the sharp nature of cacti. The colors bring a gentleness and stillness to these giants of the Arizona desert.

      <h3>Tetons on the Farm</h3>
      <p>
        The fields of Idaho seem to go on forever. The expanse of a panorama conveys the openness of the land. Not too far away from this scene is a small white farmhouse. As I captured this scene, I thought of the simpleness to be found in a life on the farm. The home feeling so small compared to the surrounding landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bright colors reflect the simplicity and cheeriness of what I felt as I stood there on that dirt road. The sweeping hills and subtle greens still present in the crops bring your eyes from the bottom left towards the majesty of Grand Teton. The empty sky can help you almost feel the warm soothing air of late summer. These are the kind of scenes I imagine when I hear, “America the Beautiful.”
